# README
## PLAN

* going to replace the datagrid gem with manual code for learning and control
* check I'm using button_to for the download link
* more dashboard data: top authors and books by year published
* Add tags
* Add comments
* Typeaheads on authors?
* Add wishlist
* Better authentication
* Make it look nice
* think about whether to move authors to their own table - right now I don't see the point (might make counts faster, but DB is small)
