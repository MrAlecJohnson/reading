# README
## PLAN

* more dashboard data: top authors and books by year published
* Fix the filters so they're interactive
* Add tags
* Add comments
* Typeaheads on authors?
* Add wishlist
* Better authentication
* Make it look nice
* think about whether to move authors to their own table - right now I don't see the point (might make counts faster, but DB is small)
