# README
## PLAN

* Split off authors table for author counts and consistent data. When I do this: 
    def fullname
        "#{firstname} #{lastname}"
    end

* Proper database (Postgres needed for Heroku)
* Host and deploy
* more dashboard data: top authors and books by year published
* Add tags
* Add comments
* Typeaheads on authors
* Better authentication
* Make it look nice
* Add wishlist
