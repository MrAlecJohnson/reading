# README
## PLAN


* how to get lower() sorting on the string columns but not the others? 
* export/download (using button_to)
* more dashboard data: top authors and books by year published
* Add tags
* Add comments
* Typeaheads on authors?
* Add wishlist
* Better authentication
* Make it look nice
* think about whether to move authors to their own table - right now I don't see the point (might make counts faster, but DB is small)
